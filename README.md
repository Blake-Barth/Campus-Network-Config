🏫 Campus Network Configuration (In Progress)

This project is a simulated campus network built using Cisco Packet Tracer as part of my ongoing preparation for the CCNA certification. The goal is to design and configure a secure, scalable, and segmented network that reflects real-world best practices for campus environments.
🛠️ Tools & Technologies

    Cisco Packet Tracer (latest version)

    Cisco IOS (via simulated routers and switches)

    Layer 2 & Layer 3 networking concepts

🎯 Objectives

Design a realistic campus topology

Configure VLANs and trunking across multiple switches

Implement inter-VLAN routing via a Layer 3 switch or router-on-a-stick

Apply basic security configurations (port security, SSH, etc.)

Enable DHCP for dynamic IP assignment

Configure static and dynamic routing (e.g., RIP, OSPF)

Simulate end-user connectivity and failover scenarios

Document configuration and justify design decisions
